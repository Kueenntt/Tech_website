    <h2>The Game</h2>
    <p>
      The game of basketball is fast, dynamic, and full of drama. Played on a rectangular court, two teams compete by moving the ball with skill and speed, always aiming to score by shooting through a hoop placed ten feet above the ground. Each game unfolds with a unique blend of strategy and spontaneous teamwork, creating an atmosphere that is both electrifying and unpredictable.
    </p>

    <p>
      To excel in basketball, players rely on fundamental skills such as dribbling, passing, and shooting. Each possession is a chance to outwit opponents, and defensive maneuvers such as blocking shots or stealing the ball can instantly change the pace of the game. Teamwork lies at the heart of success; communicating, anticipating each other’s moves, and executing well-timed plays can mean the difference between victory and defeat. The excitement builds as the score rises and the clock ticks down toward that final buzzer.

      Basketball is not just physically demanding—it challenges players to think quickly and adapt to changing situations. From intense practice sessions to high-stakes competitions, athletes train to build stamina, develop sharp instincts, and refine their coordination. The competitive spirit of basketball pushes both individuals and teams to grow, making every match an opportunity to learn and improve.

    <h2>Players</h2>
    <p>
      Basketball players bring diversity and excitement to the game through their unique skills and roles. Guards are known for their agility and ball-handling abilities, often setting the pace of play and orchestrating attacks. Forwards blend power with finesse, excelling in scoring and defending. Centers, celebrated for their height and strength, anchor the defense around the rim and dominate in rebounding battles.

    <p>
      Dedication to training is essential for every player. Hours are spent practicing dribbling, perfecting jump shots, strengthening defensive footwork, and running drills to improve teamwork. Communication and understanding among teammates are crucial; players must anticipate movements and react instantly to changes, relying on trust and shared vision to succeed on the court. Highlights of basketball history reveal how great players have inspired generations through spectacular performances, resilience, and leadership.

      I made this website to learn how to create a full webpage from scratch and to share my interests with others in a clear and interactive way. I wanted to practice organizing content into sections so that everything is easy to read and navigate. First, I planned what sections I needed, like Home, The Game, Players, and About Me. Then I wrote the HTML code to create headings, paragraphs, images, and videos for each section. I used a navigation menu so that visitors can quickly jump to different parts of the site, and I made sure each link worked properly. Adding images and videos was fun because it made the website look more lively and interesting. I also included links to my GitHub and explanation pages to show my work and make it easy for others to learn from it. While coding, I tested the website frequently to make sure that all the images, videos, and links worked correctly and that the text was readable on different screen sizes. I learned that even small details like labeling images with alt text, using horizontal lines to separate sections, and highlighting important words make a website look more professional and easier to understand. Overall, making this website taught me a lot about how web pages are structured, how to combine different types of media, and how to present information in an organized way. I feel proud because I was able to plan, build, and share a complete website on my own.

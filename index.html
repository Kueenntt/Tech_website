  <div class="section" id="game">
    <h2>The Game</h2>
    <p>
      Basketball is a fast-paced team sport played on a rectangular court. Two teams compete to score by shooting a ball through a hoop 10 feet high.
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.photos-public-domain.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/outdoor-basketball-hoop.jpg" alt="Basketball hoop in a park" />
    <p>
      Teams use dribbling, passing, and shooting to outscore opponents. Defenders block shots, steal the ball, and try to control the game.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game requires stamina, quick thinking, and coordination. Players must anticipate moves, communicate effectively, and adjust strategies mid-game. Watching professional matches teaches valuable lessons about teamwork and tactics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basketball is also about mental toughness and sportsmanship. Players learn to respect opponents, stay focused under pressure, and celebrate achievements together.

  <!-- ===== PLAYERS SECTION ===== -->

    <h2>Players</h2>
    <p>
      Each player has a role: guards handle the ball and are fast, forwards combine strength and speed, centers are tall and defend the rim.
    </p>

      Players train intensively, practicing dribbling, shooting, passing, and defense. Teamwork is crucial; predicting teammates’ movements and maintaining communication can decide a game.
    </p>

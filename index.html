      Welcome to my basketball website — a place where passion meets design, and the energy of the sport
      comes alive. Here, you will find a journey through what makes basketball so thrilling: the rules,
      the players, and the moments that define the game.

      Below is a video that gives a great introduction to basketball: how it started, how it's played, and why
      millions of people love it around the world.

    <h2>The Game</h2>
    <p>
      Basketball is a fast-paced, high-energy team sport played on a rectangular court. Two teams, each
      with five players on the floor, aim to outscore each other by shooting a round ball through a hoop that
      stands 10 feet off the ground. The hoop is mounted on a backboard, and each successful shot scores
      points depending on how far the shooter was when they released the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game starts with a “jump ball,” where two opposing players jump to tap the ball to their teammates.
      Throughout the match, players dribble (bounce) the ball while moving, pass it to teammates, or take
      shots. Defenders try to block shots and steal the ball, relying on strategy, speed, and teamwork.
    </p>

      This video explains the basic rules and structure of basketball — how scoring works, what fouls are,
      and how teams organize their offense and defense.

  <!-- PLAYERS SECTION -->
  <div class="section" id="players">
    <h2>Players</h2>
    <p>
      In basketball, each player has a unique role that contributes to the team's success. There are guards,
      forwards, and centers. Guards are typically quicker and handle the ball more; forwards combine speed
      and strength; centers are often the tallest and protect the rim. Every player trains hard — working
      on their dribbling, shooting, passing, and defensive abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players also rely on teamwork and communication. A great play often comes from sharing the ball and
      predicting where teammates will be. Defense is just as important — players must be able to guard their
      opponents, contest shots, and secure rebounds.

      showcasing dribbles, dunks, and the athleticism that makes the sport so inspiring.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Kuenzang Tobgyal</strong>, and I am studying in the <strong>ninth grade at The Royal Academy</strong>. 
      I have always carried in my heart a fiery passion for basketball — its rhythm, its teamwork, and the way it brings people together. 
      Through this website, I hope to share that passion with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created this site for the <strong>Tech Domain</strong>, not just as a school project, but as a canvas to express
      my love for the game. Basketball, to me, is not just a sport — it is poetry in motion. The bounce of the
      ball, the swish of the net, the echo of cheers: they all tell a story of unity, ambition, and heart.

      Below is a video that reflects what basketball means to me — a blend of skill, passion, and the
      magic of every moment on the court.

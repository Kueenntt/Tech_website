    <h2>The Game</h2>
    <p>
      Basketball is a fast-paced team sport played on a rectangular court. Two teams compete to score by shooting a ball through a hoop 10 feet high.
    </p>

    <p>
      Teams use dribbling, passing, and shooting to outscore opponents. Defenders block shots, steal the ball, and try to control the game.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game requires stamina, quick thinking, and coordination. Players must anticipate moves, communicate effectively, and adjust strategies mid-game.

  <div class="section" id="players">
    <h2>Players</h2>
    <p>
      Each player has a role: guards handle the ball and are fast, forwards combine strength and speed, centers are tall and defend the rim.
    </p>

    <p>
      Players train intensively, practicing dribbling, shooting, passing, and defense. Teamwork is crucial; predicting teammates’ movements and maintaining communication can decide a game.
    </p>
